Recipe - FAAM core
==================

FAAM core data have been available as NetCDF ever since the 1st FAAM science flight took place back in 2004. However, details of the NetCDF have changed over time and the FAAM_Dataset class helps to iron out those small annoyances. Maybe at some point all FAAM flights will be reprocessed to create an unified format.
