The faampy repository contains a number of python modules and scripts that handle data from the `FAAM <http://www.faam.ac.uk/>`_ aircraft. The goal of faampy is it to provide useful and stable tools that deals with many common tasks. It focuses on general utilities rather than very specific scientific problems. From experience many tasks (data merging, mapping, etc.) are common no matter which background the user has (Aerosol, Chemistry, Cloud Physics, ...). faampy is meant to be for the FAAM community **by** the FAAM community. Therefore users are encouraged to report/fix bugs and send in suggestions for improvements.
